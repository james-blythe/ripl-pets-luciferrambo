# RIPL Pet Directory

This project provides a card for each RIPL pet using ReactJS, CSS and HTML. RIPL features 3 pets at a time, which are noted in the JSON file.

## Features

- Responsive design – the site should never expand beyond 3 columns of cards but should shrink to a single column depending on the browser size.
- Filter – a filter functionality should be included to filter by either tag or owner. Attributes of each pet not highlighted elsewhere should be considered a tag.
- Pagination – so that the page does not scroll for too long, pagination should be included after nine pets. The first page will include 3 featured pets and six regular pets. All other subsequent pages will contain nine pets.
- Unit Tests – Unit tests have been implemented using React Testing Library.

- Node.js
